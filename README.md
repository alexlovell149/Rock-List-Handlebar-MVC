# Rock-List-Handlebar-MVC
App compiling a list of best Rockbands of all time to add to a MySQL database

Technologies used:
1.MySQL
2.Express
3.Express-Handlebars
4. Body Parser

Used the MVC method along with ORM configuration allowing me to have a layout of folders that flows and allows any coder to easily find what part of my file handles file paths and what handles sending information to the end-user. 
ORM allows us to shorten the code needed to pass info from the mySQL database and utilize file paths and functions to post and get info. 

Rock On!
